# lib-go

> A library of reusable code for my personal Go projects.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

When creating Go projects, there are some code blocks and keep repeating in every project. Ex: Logging, glue code, utilities, etc.

The purpose of this repo, is to provide a personal library of that shared code, so I stop having to repeat it in all the my projects.

## ðŸ“‹ What is included

- Logger
- Tracing Setup with for OpenTelemetry
- Health checks
- Database and Migrations
- Misc utils to work with Pointers, time and more

### ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

One of the great features of Go is itÂ´s rich standard library. This library tries to use standard library functions (Ex: `net/http`) to make it compatible with different projects and reduce the number of external dependencies.

Still, this is an opinionated library and some abstractions requires external dependencies. (Ex: `zap` for logging).
