# lib-go

> A library of reusable code for my Go projects.

## Motivation

When creating Go projects, there are some code blocks and keep repeating in every project. Ex: Logging, glue code, utilities, etc.

The purpose of this repo, is to provide a personal library of that shared code, so I stop having to repeat it in all the my projects.
